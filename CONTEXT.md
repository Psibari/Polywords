# POLYWORDS Current Context

Updated July 21, 2026. Active branch: `play-screen-overhaul`.

## Current Build

Hunt/Polly rebuild in progress — plan: docs/HUNT_POLLY_REBUILD_PLAN.md (read first).
Shipped + tagged today, all tsc-clean + device-confirmed:
- Phase 1 (tag v0.working-20260721-phase1): engine owns per-run bossOutcome ('pending'|'mastered'|'haunted') + bossFlawless. Rule: survive boss tiles → mystery unlocks → correct = MASTERED regardless of visible mistakes; wrong mystery or boss death = HAUNTED. Persistence reconciled off the outcome in useGameStore; MaskBoard is presenter-only. Loss-laugh echo/replay-lag fixed (GAME_OVER_LAUGH.sfx=null; ResultsScreen owns the loss laugh).
- Phase 2 (tag v0.working-20260721-phase2): Results/rank/Polly-memory read bossOutcome, not score. FLAWLESS badge on clean master. Rank is score-only.
- Phase 3 (tag v0.working-20260721-phase3): deleted dead session.ts (12-round SESSION contradicting canon). generateHunt is the only arc source (10 rounds, boss idx 9, haunt idx 7). createGame requires steps. hasBossContent requires hiddenMeaning && hiddenTrap.
- Phase 4 (tag v0.working-20260721-phase4): scoring single-sourced in polyRunEngine (chainMultiplierForStreak + point helpers), MaskBoard reads them; dropped dead createGame ghostWordIds param; GAME_REFERENCE ranks reconciled to ranks.ts + dead rare-300 claim removed. No behavior change.

Locked run-end verdicts (from bossOutcome): mastered → "SLIPPED PAST POLLY'S TRAP"; survived-not-mastered → "ALMOST, BUT ALMOST DOESN'T COUNT."; died → "GOT SNAPPED BY POLLY'S TRAP".
