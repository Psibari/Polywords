# POLYWORDS Current Context

Updated 2026-10-05. Current state + next work only. `CLAUDE.md` owns durable architecture;
focused rules live in `docs/`; runtime code/data outrank docs.

## Branches

| Branch | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `play-screen-overhaul` | Main working branch. |
| `daily-castle-test` | Finished and merged. Do not work on it. |
| `onboarding-wip` | Finished and merged. Do not work on it. |
| `main` | Stale. Never merge into it without Pete's approval. |

Phone testing uses the local checkout, not GitHub. Pull `play-screen-overhaul` before Expo testing.

## Current State

- **Hunt:** UP claims a REAL; RIGHT rejects a trap. Standard arc is 10 rounds; fledgling is 8.
  Polly's Word is final. Returning Haunt is round 5 standard / round 4 fledgling.
- **Hunt content/runtime integrity:** the 2026-10-05 audited replacements and metadata repairs
  live directly in canonical `assets/data/huntData.json`; the temporary runtime override layer is
  retired. Hunt entries validate at load so malformed difficulty/gpsTag, missing/duplicate mask
  IDs, invalid REAL/trap flags, missing swipe-direction coverage, or Boss entries without hidden
  content fail loudly instead of being silently bypassed. Existing GPS arc, fallback pools,
  mastery revisits, Boss selection and Returning Haunt behavior remain.
- **First-run onboarding:** merged, device-approved, locked. FINE teaches recognition on the real
  board; HUD lessons teach feathers, momentum, a broken run and Hunt progress.
- **Daily castle:** device-approved and locked. Do not reopen the castle art for the deferred
  answer-stone entrance issue.
- **Polybook:** portrait Living Journal interior is device-approved and locked. Closed book opens
  to one portrait page; navigation is TODAY / JOURNAL / MASTERY with bottom forked ribbons.
  Closed-cover side-ribbon cleanup remains deferred.
- **Visual system:** shared grammar, not identical skins (`DESIGN.md`). Daily Entry and Settings
  use the utility-panel family where it helps; Daily Results, Boss intro/outcome, Hunt decisions,
  Polybook pages and first-run teaching keep their stronger native treatments.
- **Polly relationship:** Relationship Memory V2 and its comeback/slump/return/Haunt dialogue
  presentation are implemented and device-checked.
- **Polly animation:** the ALIVE LOOP whole-image experiment was rejected. Existing Rig 2 is
  useful for face/crown motion but the baked body cannot provide convincing head/wing/feet/tail
  articulation. Do not promote the rocking experiment to production.
- **Results:** Hunt Results remains the last major visual surface awaiting a focused keep/change
  audit. Do not assume it needs redesign.
- **TestFlight:** build/submit/install works end to end. Store name remains
  `POLYWORDS: Hunt or Be Trapped`; iPad support is off.

## Current Product Rulings

- Recognition over vocabulary instruction.
- Rank and score are player-facing nowhere.
- Mastery comes from the Boss gauntlet, not score.
- Haunted words return; a successful rematch banishes the active Haunt.
- Daily is deterministic, five rounds, UP-only, two lives, one attempt per date.
- Gold is scarce and meaningful; ordinary choices stay neutral before commitment.
- Visual consistency requires a player-facing benefit, not cosmetic sameness.

## Next Work

**Single most valuable next step:** prove the minimum viable articulated Polly Rig 3 before
adding more character-state animation or returning to Polybook crown progression.

Next three actions, in order:
1. Inventory clean separated Polly art in `assets/images/polly/rig/`, `rig2/`, `flight-rig/`,
   poses and large PNG sources; identify reusable vs rough/dormant pieces.
2. Build a DEV-only articulated Neutral prototype in the Polly Face Rig workbench using real
   part movement rather than whole-sticker rocking.
3. Prove one 30–60 second Neutral living sequence: blink + glance/attention + weight/posture
   shift + settle, with irregular quiet gaps, before adding other life profiles or production Home.

## Do Not Work On Yet

- New Polly art or WEBP restoration before the articulation inventory.
- Production Home life-profile animation before the DEV Neutral proof.
- Crown/Polybook progression, additional relationship states, or Polybook interior changes.
- Changes to the device-approved `BROW_FOLLOW = 0.33`.
- Daily answer-stone initial pop-in or decorative passes on approved screens.
- Re-skinning strong native surfaces merely to make screens look alike.
- Deleting the old Lexicon rollback path without Pete's decision.

## Acceptance / Verification for Polly Rig 3 Proof

- Polly reads as alive without dialogue or labels.
- Motion comes from believable articulation, not rotating the whole image.
- Reaction and resting disposition remain distinct; apparent size/anchor stays stable.
- No clipping or alpha defects.
- Reduce Motion remains authoritative in production.
- PC proof precedes production Home and phone verification.

## Protection

Preserve every stash and unrelated worktree change. Pete's local art is his; do not touch
untracked/local art without approval. No branch merges without Pete's approval.
